# v-lazy-show

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/v-lazy-show?color=a1b858&label=)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/v-lazy-show)

A compile-time directive to lazy initialize v-show for Vue. It makes components mount after first truthy value (`v-if`), and the DOM keep alive when toggling (`v-show`).

## Install

```bash
npm i -D v-lazy-show
```

This package is completely compile-time, installed it as a `nodeTransformer` in Vue's compiler options.

For example in Vite:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { transformLazyShow } from 'v-lazy-show'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    Vue({
      template: {
        compilerOptions: {
          nodeTransforms: [
            transformLazyShow, // <--- add this
          ],
        },
      },
    }),
  ]
})
```

In Nuxt:

```ts
// nuxt.config.ts
import { transformLazyShow } from 'v-lazy-show'

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  vue: {
    compilerOptions: {
      nodeTransforms: [
        transformLazyShow, // <--- add this
      ],
    },
  },
})
```

> **Note**: There are some hydration issues with SSR, we are still investigating it.

## Usage

You can use it as a directive. Both `v-lazy-show` and `v-show.lazy` are supported and equivalent.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const show = ref(false)
</script>

<template>
  <div v-lazy-show="show">
    <MyComponent />
  </div>
</template>
```

With it, `<MyComponent />` will not be mounted for the first render. Until the first time `show.value = true`, it will be mounted and the DOM will be kept alive. Later if you switch `show.value` back to `false`, `<MyComponent />` will not be unmounted, instead, `display: none` will be applied to the DOM just like `v-show`.

## Use Cases

It can be helpful to use with some component that is expensive to create/mount. For example, if you have a tabs component, that some tab contains a heavy component. Using `v-if`, it will get the component destroyed and re-created when switching tabs. Using `v-show`, you will need to pay the mounting cost on the initial render even you haven't switch to that tab yet.

With `v-lazy-show`, you can have the best of both worlds. You can think it as a `v-show` that lazy initializes, or a `v-if` that caches the DOM.

Similarly, this can be helpful for `<details>`, `<dialog>`, `<tabs>`, `<popups>` and other components that you want to keep the DOM alive when toggling.

## How does it work?

Like how `v-if` works, when you use this directive, it hint the compiler to do some transformation to the generated vnodes.

```vue
<template>
  <div v-lazy-show="foo">
    Hello
  </div>
</template>
```

will be compiled to

```ts
import { Fragment as _Fragment, createCommentVNode as _createCommentVNode, createElementBlock as _createElementBlock, createElementVNode as _createElementVNode, openBlock as _openBlock, vShow as _vShow, withDirectives as _withDirectives } from 'vue'

export function render(_ctx, _cache) {
  return (_cache._lazyshow1 || _ctx.foo)
    ? (_cache._lazyshow1 = true, (_openBlock(),
      _withDirectives(_createElementVNode('div', null, ' Hello ', 512 /* NEED_PATCH */), [
        [_vShow, _ctx.foo]
      ])))
    : _createCommentVNode('v-show-if', true)
}
```
